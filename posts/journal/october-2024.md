month: "October 2024"
title: "Building Roadwise and Fresh Ideas"
---

This month,  I started working on Roadwise, a new idea for a roadmap creation app. The goal of Roadwise is to let developers quickly set up feedback boards for their applications, where users can suggest and vote on features. It’s a project I’m excited about, and I’m eager to see how it evolves.

Aside from working on this new idea, I also spent time preparing for my upcoming university exams. Balancing both the app development and exam prep has been challenging but rewarding.

I also discovered two fantastic YouTube channels this month: T3dotgg and ThePrimeTime. Both channels are packed with tech news, coding tips, and valuable insights, helping me level up in both frontend and backend development.

- [T3dotgg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) – Delivers tech news faster than JavaScript developers create new frameworks.
- [ThePrimeTime](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) –  Big brain, bigger ego, but always dropping knowledge bombs.
