month: "September 2024"
title: "The Beginning of My Full-Stack Journey"
---

This month marked a turning point for me as I began taking full-stack development more seriously. I’ve realized that building web applications is something I truly enjoy, especially knowing they can be accessed from anywhere in the world. It’s an amazing and rewarding experience to create something that lives online.

Right now, I’m focusing on mastering **Next.js** and refining my overall web development stack. Alongside this, I’ve been juggling the start of my second year of studies, a new job, and staying active in sports. While it’s been a busy time, I’m learning how to connect all these activities and make the most of the time I have.
