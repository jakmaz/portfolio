When I was younger, Minecraft was the most popular game around, and I was no exception to the craze. My dad had an iPad from work, and I spent hours playing the **Pocket Edition** version of the game. Although it was fun, it lacked many features from the PC version, which I really wanted to try. When I eventually got a PC, I immediately became hooked on creating things—especially automated systems. While other players were building houses, I was busy trying to automate every possible task using Redstone. Whether it was machines or farms, I loved figuring out how to make things work on their own.

### Innotech Labs and My First Coding Experience

In 2016, free coding workshops called **Innotech Labs** started in my town, led by **Konrad Strzelecki**. I signed up and really enjoyed the experience. The labs were held every weekend morning, and I found myself waiting the whole week for them. Each session, Konrad brought a big pack of cookies, and we worked on a variety of cool projects. We played with drones, built **Lego Mindstorms** robots, coded in **Scratch**, and even started with **JavaScript**—my first programming language.

The labs continued for a couple of years before they eventually stopped. After they ended, I asked for materials to continue learning on my own, but eventually, I also took a break as I started high school and focused on other things.

### Rediscovering Coding

A few years later, I came across a YouTube video that sparked my interest in coding again. The video showed how to send a bee script over WhatsApp using **Python**, which was exciting for me because it involved **automation**—something I always enjoyed. I followed the tutorial, downloaded Python, and successfully sent the script to a friend. The fun of making it work led me to explore more with automation.

I searched for more tutorials and found a video about creating a **Piano Tiles bot** using **pyautogui**, a Python library for automation. That project opened up a new world for me. I spent a lot of time coding Python scripts for automating tasks, mostly involving **screen scanning** and **desktop apps**. I even started exploring **APIs** and sending requests, which made me realize just how much coding could do.

### Finding My Path

In high school, I studied to become an **automation technician**, but I soon realized that I wasn’t really interested in electronics and physical systems. I knew I wanted to focus on software, so I decided to pursue **Computer Science** at **Maastricht University**.

Once I started my university studies, I began learning the fundamentals of programming and computer science in a structured way. While I had played around with coding before, this was where I started learning real concepts. I explored topics like **Java**, **static typing**, **computer networks**, **data structures**, and much more. Though I haven’t learned everything yet, I’m enjoying the process and feel like I’m building a strong foundation.

Beyond just the coursework, I’ve started working on **side projects** that allow me to create useful tools and solutions. It's rewarding to see something I’ve built help others, and that drives me to continue learning and improving my skills.
